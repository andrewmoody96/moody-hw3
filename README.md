# Moody-HW3 JavaScript: Password Generator
This application generates a random password from 8 to 128 characters, based on the selected criteria. Users may include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. 

The application verifies that at least one of the criteria has been selected and also that the minimum and maximum length specifications have been met. If they are not, an error message is displayed.
